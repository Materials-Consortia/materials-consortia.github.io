# About us

The **Open Databases Integration for Materials Design** (OPTIMADE) consortium
aims to make materials databases interoperable by developing a specification
for a common REST API.

## Motivation

Designing new materials suitable for specific applications is a long,
complex, and costly process. Researchers think of new ideas based on
intuition and experience. Their synthesis and evaluation require a
tremendous amount of trial and error. In the last few years, there has
been a major game change in materials design. Thanks to the exponential
growth of computer power and the development of robust first-principles
electronic structure codes, it has become possible to perform large sets
of calculations automatically. This is the burgeoning area of
high-throughput ab initio computation. Such calculations have been used
to create large databases containing the calculated properties of
existing and hypothetical materials, many of which have appeared online.

We have released version 1.0 of the OPTIMADE specification, with several
databases already providing implementations. A full list is available on
the [OPTIMADE providers dashboard](https://www.optimade.org/providers-dashboard/).

## How to cite OPTIMADE

Should you wish to cite the OPTIMADE specification, please use the following:

- Andersen *et al*, OPTIMADE: an API for exchanging materials data (2021) [arXiv:2103.02068](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02068){:target=_blank}
- Andersen *et al*, The OPTIMADE Specification, [10.5281/zenodo.4195050](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4195050){:target=_blank}

## Get involved

All of our work is openly available under the
[Materials-Consortia](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/) organization on
GitHub and welcome all contributions.

We would love to help you create and register your own OPTIMADE API
implementations and hear your feedback on the specification.
We meet monthly in the "OPTIMADE" room on Jitsi; everyone is welcome to
join the discussion, please feel free to reach out on the mailing list
`dev[at]optimade.org` to register your interest.
The next meeting will take place on {% include {{ page.next_meeting }} %}.


With the support of [CECAM](www.cecam.org){:target=_blank}, we hold annual
workshops to discuss and develop the specification and related ideas.
The 2021 workshop will be held virtually and the announcement will appear
on the CECAM website soon.

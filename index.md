# About us

The **Open Databases Integration for Materials Design** (OPTIMADE) consortium aims to make materials databases interoperable by developing a specification for a common REST API.

## Motivation

Designing new materials suitable for specific applications is a long, complex, and costly process.
Researchers think of new ideas based on intuition and experience.
Their synthesis and evaluation require a tremendous amount of trial and error.
In the last few years, there has been a major game change in materials design.
Thanks to the exponential growth of computer power and the development of robust first-principles electronic structure codes, it has become possible to perform large sets of calculations automatically.
This is the burgeoning area of high-throughput ab initio computation.
Such calculations have been used to create large databases containing the calculated properties of existing and hypothetical materials, many of which have appeared online.

We have released version 1.0 of the OPTIMADE specification, with several databases already providing implementations.
A full list is available on the [OPTIMADE providers dashboard](https://www.optimade.org/providers-dashboard/){:target="_blank"}.

## Get involved

All of our work is openly available under the [Materials-Consortia](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/){:target="_blank"} organization on GitHub and we welcome all contributions.

Besides GitHub, we use [Slack](https://optimade.slack.com) for developer communication.
If you wish to join the workspace, please feel free to use [this invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/optimade/shared_invite/zt-rf1kjcxj-gpFfJH0WnAkafWMrxz4paA).

We would love to help you create and register your own OPTIMADE API implementations and hear your feedback on the specification.
We meet monthly in the "OPTIMADE" room on Jitsi; everyone is welcome to join the discussion, please feel free to reach out on the mailing list
`dev[at]optimade.org` to register your interest.
The next meeting will take place on {% include {{ page.next_meeting }} %}.

On the 7th and 8th of September 2021, there will be an online tutorial on how to use the OPTIMADE API.
It will feature hands-on sessions on creating queries and analyzing the server responses. 
The tutorial is part of the [NOMAD Virtual Tutorial Series](https://th.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/meetings/nomad-tutorials/).
More information can be found via this [link](https://th.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/meetings/nomad-tutorials/index.php?n=Meeting.Tutorial6).
You can register for this tutorial [here](https://th.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/meetings/nomad-tutorials/index.php?n=Registration.Application).

With the support of [CECAM](https://www.cecam.org){:target="_blank"}, we hold [annual workshops](https://www.cecam.org/search#stq=%22Open%20Databases%20Integration%20for%20Materials%20Design%22&stp=1){:target="_blank"} to discuss and develop the specification and related ideas.
The latest 2021 workshop was held virtually between June 7th and June 11th, with sessions accommodating multiple timezones.

**OMDI2021**: Related to the central OPTIMADE efforts, the *Workshop on Ontologies for Materials-Databases Interoperability 2021* is being held at Linköping University, Sweden at **October 5-7, 2021**.
The workshop will be held partially online.
